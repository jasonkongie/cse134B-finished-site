#Updates: 
- I first simplified the content based on Homework 2's skeleton html 
- I also implemented a rudimentary css file (with only a grey background color)
- Then, I meticulously updated the css styles sheet to make the background (vinyl motif) more aesthetic - used repeat so that it is a theme
- More in particular, I changed the theme to lavendar and a greenish color
- I also added an AI generated image of the real bradon xu (LOL) using Apple Intelligence
- I also reused my part 1 and part 2 code to create Blog and Research cards, which is stored in the LocalStorage
- while doing the extra credit for CRUD, I created a pretty nice form. It allows for create, update, and delete
- Then, since I feel like this form is quite aestheitic, I also copied it to be used for the contact form (for allowing users to submit their email)
- For the contact form, i added some validation to make sure the email is valid -- having a @

That's about it! Thanks!
